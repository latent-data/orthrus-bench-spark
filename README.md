# Orthrus-Qwen3-8B benchmark on NVIDIA DGX Spark

Reproducible throughput benchmark comparing the Orthrus-Qwen3-8B diffusion LM against a stock Qwen3-8B autoregressive baseline on GB10 (sm_121) hardware.

## TL;DR

Results on two prompts (greedy decoding, max 2048 new tokens, single run):

| Prompt | Orthrus diffusion | Qwen3-8B AR | Speedup (diffusion vs AR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| short (word frequency) | 38.6 tok/s | 11.4 tok/s | 3.38x |
| long (BoundedPriorityQueue) | 50.7 tok/s | 11.2 tok/s | 4.52x |
| **geometric mean** | | | **3.91x** |

Orthrus diffusion throughput increases with output length (38.6 to 50.7 tok/s) while Qwen3-8B AR stays flat (~11.3 tok/s), as expected: diffusion generates tokens in parallel passes that amortise better over longer sequences. The per-prompt speedup variation (3.38x short vs 4.52x long) is itself a finding worth reporting alongside the geometric mean.

Diffusion's throughput advantage is expected to grow with output length because Orthrus generates tokens in parallel passes while AR decoding scales linearly. If the per-prompt speedups differ substantially (e.g. 3x short vs 6x long), that finding is reported explicitly -- the geometric mean is the right summary statistic but the per-prompt breakdown is the interesting result.

## Hardware tested

- **System:** NVIDIA DGX Spark
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GB10, compute capability 12.1 (sm_121), 128 GB unified memory
- **CPU:** aarch64
- **Container:** `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.12-py3`
- **torch:** 2.10.0a0+...nv25.12 (custom NGC build, not a PyPI release)
- **flash-attn:** 2.7.x (preinstalled in container)
- **transformers:** 5.8.1
- **accelerate:** 1.13.0

## What this measures and what it does not

**Measured:** single-stream throughput on two fixed prompts with greedy (deterministic) decoding, up to 2048 new tokens each.

**Not measured:** output quality, latency under concurrent load, batch throughput, different prompts, sampling strategies.

**Why stock Qwen3-8B and not Orthrus's own AR mode:**
Orthrus exposes a `use_diffusion_mode=False` flag, but this is not a clean autoregressive path. The model was trained with bidirectional attention, so it has no KV cache in that mode and its numbers are not a fair comparison to standard AR decoding. Stock Qwen3-8B with a proper KV cache is the honest baseline. The `use_diffusion_mode=False` measurement is available via `--include-nodiff` for transparency, but it is not the comparison worth quoting.

**Why two prompts:**
A single short prompt under-represents Orthrus's advantage. Diffusion models generate tokens in parallel passes; the benefit grows with output length. The long prompt (BoundedPriorityQueue implementation + test suite) produces significantly more tokens and gives a second data point on how speedup scales. The geometric mean across both prompts is the headline number; the per-prompt breakdown is worth inspecting.

**Expected runtime:** approximately 10-15 minutes total on a DGX Spark for the default run (diffusion + Qwen3-8B AR, two prompts). Adding `--include-nodiff` roughly doubles the runtime; the `use_diffusion_mode=False` mode is O(n^2) in output length.

## Quick start

```
git clone <this repo>
cd <repo dir>
./run.sh
```

To skip the Docker build step and run directly in a pulled NGC container:

```
./run.sh --no-build
```

Results appear in `results/results.json`. First run downloads approximately 35 GB of model weights into `~/.cache/huggingface`.

## Configuration

Flags are forwarded from `run.sh` to `benchmark.py`:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--prompts NAME` | short, long | Named prompt(s) to run. Repeatable. |
| `--max-new-tokens` | 2048 | Maximum tokens to generate per run |
| `--warmup-tokens` | 32 | Tokens generated before timing starts |
| `--runs N` | 1 | Timed runs per config; results averaged |
| `--seed S` | none | RNG seed (output already deterministic with greedy decoding) |
| `--include-nodiff` | off | Also run `use_diffusion_mode=False`. Slow: O(n^2), expect 10+ min per run on the long prompt |
| `--output` | results/results.json | Path for JSON output |
| `--orthrus-revision` | pinned SHA | HF commit for chiennv/Orthrus-Qwen3-8B |
| `--qwen-revision` | pinned SHA | HF commit for Qwen/Qwen3-8B |

Examples:

```bash
# Run only the short prompt
./run.sh --no-build --prompts short

# Custom output path
./run.sh --no-build --output results/my_run.json
```

## Output format

See `results/EXAMPLE_results.json` for the full schema. Top-level fields:

- `timestamp_utc` - ISO 8601 timestamp
- `hardware` - device name, compute capability, memory
- `container` - image tag and name (baked in by Dockerfile)
- `software` - torch, CUDA, transformers, accelerate, flash-attn versions
- `config` - prompts selected, token limits, decoding settings, pinned revisions
- `results` - keyed by prompt name, then by config: tokens generated, elapsed seconds, tok/s, 300-char output snippet
- `speedups` - per-prompt speedup (diffusion vs Qwen3-8B AR) and `geomean` across prompts

- **Pinned dependencies:** transformers 5.8.1, accelerate 1.13.0, huggingface-hub 1.9.2 (see `requirements.txt`)
- **Deterministic decoding:** `do_sample=False` (greedy) for all configurations

## Limitations and caveats

- Targets sm_121 (GB10) on aarch64. Will not run as-is on x86_64 or other Blackwell variants without container adjustments.
- Uses flash-attn 2 only. FA3/FA4 do not yet support sm_121 as of the time this repo was authored.
- Single GPU only.
- 8B model only, no quantisation.
