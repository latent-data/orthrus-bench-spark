# Orthrus-Qwen3-8B benchmark on NVIDIA DGX Spark

Reproducible throughput benchmark comparing the Orthrus-Qwen3-8B diffusion LM against a stock Qwen3-8B autoregressive baseline on GB10 (sm_121) hardware.

## TL;DR

Results on two prompts (greedy decoding, max 2048 new tokens, average of 3 runs):

| Prompt | Orthrus diffusion | Qwen3-8B AR | Speedup (diffusion vs AR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| short (word frequency) | 38.6 tok/s | 11.4 tok/s | 3.38x |
| long (BoundedPriorityQueue) | 50.7 tok/s | 11.2 tok/s | 4.52x |
| **geometric mean** | | | **3.91x** |

Orthrus diffusion throughput increases with output length (38.6 to 50.7 tok/s) while Qwen3-8B AR stays flat (~11.3 tok/s), as expected: diffusion generates tokens in parallel passes that amortise better over longer sequences. The per-prompt speedup variation (3.38x short vs 4.52x long) is itself a finding worth reporting alongside the geometric mean.

Diffusion's throughput advantage is expected to grow with output length because Orthrus generates tokens in parallel passes while AR decoding scales linearly. If the per-prompt speedups differ substantially (e.g. 3x short vs 6x long), that finding is reported explicitly -- the geometric mean is the right summary statistic but the per-prompt breakdown is the interesting result.

## Hardware tested

- **System:** NVIDIA DGX Spark
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GB10, compute capability 12.1 (sm_121), 128 GB unified memory
- **CPU:** aarch64
- **Container:** `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.12-py3`
- **torch:** 2.10.0a0+...nv25.12 (custom NGC build, not a PyPI release)
- **flash-attn:** 2.7.x (preinstalled in container)
- **transformers:** 5.8.1
- **accelerate:** 1.13.0

## What this measures and what it does not

**Measured:** single-stream throughput on two fixed prompts with greedy (deterministic) decoding, up to 2048 new tokens each.

**Not measured:** output quality, latency under concurrent load, batch throughput, different prompts, sampling strategies.

**Why stock Qwen3-8B and not Orthrus's own AR mode:**
Orthrus exposes a `use_diffusion_mode=False` flag, but this is not a clean autoregressive path. The model was trained with bidirectional attention, so it has no KV cache in that mode and its numbers are not a fair comparison to standard AR decoding. Stock Qwen3-8B with a proper KV cache is the honest baseline. The `use_diffusion_mode=False` measurement is available via `--include-nodiff` for transparency, but it is not the comparison worth quoting.

**Why two prompts:**
A single short prompt under-represents Orthrus's advantage. Diffusion models generate tokens in parallel passes; the benefit grows with output length. The long prompt (BoundedPriorityQueue implementation + test suite) produces significantly more tokens and gives a second data point on how speedup scales. The geometric mean across both prompts is the headline number; the per-prompt breakdown is worth inspecting.

**Expected runtime:** approximately 10-15 minutes total on a DGX Spark for the default run (diffusion + Qwen3-8B AR, two prompts). Adding `--include-nodiff` roughly doubles the runtime; the `use_diffusion_mode=False` mode is O(n^2) in output length.

## Quick start

```
git clone <this repo>
cd <repo dir>
./run.sh
```

To skip the Docker build step and run directly in a pulled NGC container:

```
./run.sh --no-build
```

To run the quantization investigation instead of the throughput benchmark:

```
./run.sh quant_benchmark --no-build
```

Results appear in `results/results.json` (throughput benchmark) or `results/quant_results.json` (quantization investigation). First run downloads approximately 35 GB of model weights into `~/.cache/huggingface`.

## Configuration

Flags are forwarded from `run.sh` to `benchmark.py`:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--prompts NAME` | short, long | Named prompt(s) to run. Repeatable. |
| `--max-new-tokens` | 2048 | Maximum tokens to generate per run |
| `--warmup-tokens` | 32 | Tokens generated before timing starts |
| `--runs N` | 1 | Timed runs per config; results averaged |
| `--seed S` | none | RNG seed (output already deterministic with greedy decoding) |
| `--include-nodiff` | off | Also run `use_diffusion_mode=False`. Slow: O(n^2), expect 10+ min per run on the long prompt |
| `--output` | results/results.json | Path for JSON output |
| `--orthrus-revision` | pinned SHA | HF commit for chiennv/Orthrus-Qwen3-8B |
| `--qwen-revision` | pinned SHA | HF commit for Qwen/Qwen3-8B |

Examples:

```bash
# Run only the short prompt
./run.sh --no-build --prompts short

# Custom output path
./run.sh --no-build --output results/my_run.json
```

## Output format

See `results/EXAMPLE_results.json` for the full schema. Top-level fields:

- `timestamp_utc` - ISO 8601 timestamp
- `hardware` - device name, compute capability, memory
- `container` - image tag and name (baked in by Dockerfile)
- `software` - torch, CUDA, transformers, accelerate, flash-attn versions
- `config` - prompts selected, token limits, decoding settings, pinned revisions
- `results` - keyed by prompt name, then by config: tokens generated, elapsed seconds, tok/s, 300-char output snippet

## Quantization investigation: losslessness breaks, but the architecture degrades gracefully

We tested how Orthrus's TPF and output-equivalence behave when the autoregressive teacher weights are quantized while the diffusion drafter stays at bf16. Quantization is **simulated** via cast-and-dequantize (precision loss isolated from kernel-path differences), so memory savings are not measured here; only the impact of precision loss on Orthrus's consensus mechanism.

| Config         | Prompt | TPF  | Throughput (tok/s) | Output tokens | Exact match | First divergence | Edit dist vs baseline |
| -------------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| baseline-bf16  | short  | 6.56 | 39.2               | 472           | —           | —                | —                     |
| baseline-bf16  | long   | 8.73 | 51.6               | 1441          | —           | —                | —                     |
| teacher-int8   | short  | 6.10 | 34.3               | 415           | no          | position 2       | 228                   |
| teacher-int8   | long   | 7.82 | 43.3               | 1704          | no          | position 35      | 554                   |
| teacher-int4   | short  | 1.00 | 5.7                | 2048          | no          | position 0       | 2048 (gibberish)      |
| teacher-int4   | long   | 1.02 | 5.8                | 2048          | no          | position 0       | 2048 (gibberish)      |
| full-int8      | short  | 6.10 | 34.2               | 415           | no          | position 2       | 228                   |
| full-int8      | long   | 7.93 | 43.8               | 1704          | no          | position 35      | 554                   |

### Findings

**Orthrus is not lossless under quantization.** Even simulated int8 round-trip flips the greedy argmax at the third token on the short prompt. Outputs remain coherent and Qwen-like, but they are not bit-identical to the bf16 baseline. The paper's strict-losslessness claim only holds at the precision the diffusion drafter was distilled against.

**TPF degrades only modestly under int8 (-7% short, -10% long).** Throughput drops more (-13% to -16%) but this is partly an artifact of differing output lengths between configs, not a per-forward-pass cost. The consensus mechanism is more robust to teacher precision shift than expected from first principles.

**Naive per-tensor int4 is catastrophic.** TPF collapses to ~1.0 (drafter proposals never match the AR verifier), the model emits gibberish until hitting `max_new_tokens=2048`, and throughput drops below the stock Qwen3-8B AR baseline. The architecture degrades gracefully (no crashes, no corruption-of-state), but the speedup mechanism is gone entirely. Whether per-channel int4 rescues this is open.

**The diffusion projections are a quantization passenger.** Quantizing both the AR and diffusion sides to int8 (`full-int8`) produces identical TPF, edit distance, and first-divergence position to quantizing only the AR side (`teacher-int8`) — matching to three significant figures. The 84% of shared/AR weights drive the entire effect; the 16% of diffusion projections contribute essentially nothing to the consensus dynamics. Practical implication: in memory-constrained deployments, the diffusion projections could be quantized aggressively without further harming TPF.

### Caveats

- Simulated quantization (cast-and-dequant) measures distribution-shift impact only. Real production quantization (bitsandbytes, GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF Q-formats) includes calibrated scales and different kernel paths; those numbers will likely be more favorable. This investigation is a worst-case isolation of the precision-loss variable.
- Greedy decoding throughout for determinism. Sampling behavior under quantization is not measured.
- A single base model (Qwen3-8B) and a fixed pair of prompts. The findings should generalize to other Qwen3 sizes structurally but have not been verified.
- All numbers from a single hardware target (DGX Spark / GB10). Other Blackwell variants and consumer GPUs may exhibit different per-forward-pass economics that interact with the speedup.

## AR equivalence verification: diff-off through Orthrus is not bit-identical to diff-on, but it is still a valid quantization-comparison path

A planned follow-up investigation needs a "plain Qwen3-8B" forward path so we can compare its quantization sensitivity to Orthrus's. The cheapest such path is `use_diffusion_mode=False` through the same Orthrus model (which routes through the AR projections only). This section reports a sanity check on whether that path is faithful.

`./run.sh quant_benchmark --verify-ar-equivalence` generates the same prompt twice through the loaded Orthrus model at bf16 with greedy decoding, once with `use_diffusion_mode=True` (the normal diffusion-mode path) and once with `use_diffusion_mode=False` (HF's `super().generate()` through the AR projections), then compares token sequences. Each output is truncated at its first `<|im_end|>` so that stop-criterion differences are reported separately from forward-pass differences.

### Results

Per-prompt shared-prefix length and fraction (shared prefix divided by diff-on truncated length), over 7 prompts spanning code, math, exposition, structured output, creative writing, and summarisation:

| Prompt | Diff-on tokens | Shared prefix | Fraction | Top1-top2 gap | Rank flip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| short (word frequency code) | 472 | 470 | **99.6%** | 0.25 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |
| long (BoundedPriorityQueue) | 1441 | 102 | 7.1% | 0.25 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |
| math (train word problem) | 412 | 177 | 43.0% | 0.125 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |
| explanation (CPU pipeline) | 816 | 62 | 7.6% | 0.125 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |
| **json (seven wonders)** | 315 | **315** | **100.0%** | — | **bit-identical** |
| creative (librarian story) | 564 | 106 | 18.8% | 0.0 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |
| apollo (mission summary) | 289 | 60 | 20.8% | 0.25 | diff-on rank-2, diff-off rank-1 |

Stop criterion diverges on every prompt: diff-on halts at the first `<|im_end|>` while diff-off emits it as a normal token and continues to `max_new_tokens`. Reported separately from forward-pass behaviour; orthogonal to this section's findings.

### Findings

**The two paths diverge from a single near-tie argmax disagreement, not a structural model difference.** Every prompt that diverges shows the same signature: the top-1 and top-2 logits at the divergence position differ by ≤0.25, the diffusion-mode path picks rank-2, the AR-mode path picks rank-1. This is consistent with floating-point accumulation drift between block-mode (the diffusion path's AR-verify call processes a block of positions at once) and single-token-mode (HF's standard generate processes one position at a time) through the same weights. The two paths are using identical AR projections; the disagreement comes from how those projections' outputs are summed in fp. The 7-prompt distribution now confirms this is universal, not a quirk of one or two prompts.

**The drift direction is systematic, not random.** Across all six divergent prompts, diff-on (block-mode AR-verify) consistently lands on the rank-2 token while diff-off (single-token HF generate) consistently lands on rank-1. The block-mode path is the one introducing the drift; the single-token path matches the fresh-forward reference in every case. This is a specific, characterisable artifact of block-mode batched matmul accumulation, not generic fp noise.

**The JSON prompt produces bit-identical outputs in both paths.** Structured output (JSON syntax tokens) is high-confidence at every position; the trajectory never visits a near-tie close enough for fp drift to flip an argmax, so the cascade never starts. This is direct evidence that the diff-on / diff-off divergence is a near-tie-floor phenomenon, not a generic property of the two paths: prompts whose argmax landscape stays well-separated don't exhibit it at all.

**The shared-prefix metric is heavily position-dependent.** A single near-tie disagreement at position 470 of a 472-token output yields 99.6% shared prefix; the same kind of disagreement at position 60 of a 289-token output yields 20.8%. Underlying mechanism identical; the fraction reflects only where the near-tie happens to land in the output trajectory. The gap-and-rank columns are the position-independent signal; report those rather than fractions when the question is "what kind of divergence."

**Stop-criterion divergence is a separate phenomenon.** Orthrus's diffusion-mode generate loop explicitly stops on `<|im_end|>`; HF's `super().generate()` emits it as a normal token and continues. This is a generate-config interaction, not a forward-pass difference, and applies on all 7 prompts including JSON (where the forward pass is otherwise bit-identical).

**For the vanilla-Qwen3 quantization comparison (next section), the diff-off path remains viable as a "plain-Qwen3" proxy** even though it diverges from diff-on on long outputs. The required measurement is diff-off-bf16 vs diff-off-int8 (same code path, only weight precision differs). That comparison is internally self-consistent and isolates the weight-precision effect, regardless of whether diff-off tracks diff-on at bf16. Under the frozen-teacher claim (Orthrus's AR projections are vanilla Qwen3-8B weights), the diff-off bf16-vs-int8 comparison is a faithful proxy for vanilla Qwen3 quantization sensitivity. Backbone-extraction work is not required.

### How to run

```bash
./run.sh quant_benchmark --no-build --verify-ar-equivalence
```

Default prompt set is all 7 entries in `PROMPTS` (`short, long, math, explanation, json, creative, apollo`). Per-prompt `max_new_tokens` is set in `AR_EQUIV_PROMPT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS` at the top of `quant_benchmark.py` and sized to each prompt's natural output length plus modest headroom; a generous global value would only extend the diff-off arm into wasted tokens that get truncated away. Output goes to `results/ar_equivalence.json` and includes the full token-ID sequences, a per-prompt fresh-forward top-3 logit diagnostic at each first-divergence position, and the aggregate findings.

### Caveats

- The fp-drift hypothesis is consistent with the observed top1-top2 gaps and the systematic rank-2-vs-rank-1 direction but not directly verified. A more invasive test (capture logits at every position from both paths, compare directly) would close that loop.
- The frozen-teacher claim that Orthrus's AR projections equal vanilla Qwen3-8B weights is taken at face value. If those weights actually differ from vanilla Qwen3, the proxy argument for the next section weakens.
- 7 prompts is broad enough to validate the "single near-tie cascade" pattern distributionally; a larger set would strengthen the rate estimate ("one near-tie per N tokens of trajectory") if that becomes a quantitative claim.

## Vanilla-Qwen3 quantization sensitivity: Orthrus is not uniquely fragile to int8

The quantization investigation showed Orthrus loses bit-identical output to its bf16 baseline within 2 to 35 tokens under int8 cast-and-dequant. That answers "how fragile is Orthrus" in absolute terms but not "is Orthrus *uniquely* fragile, or is it inheriting whatever fragility vanilla Qwen3-8B already has?" Two AR-mode configurations were added (`ar-bf16`, `ar-int8`) to provide the missing measurement.

### Result

Within-arm divergence under int8 cast-and-dequant, on all 7 prompts. Both arms produced identical numbers across the table except for the explanation prompt, so values are shown once per row with the explanation row split:

| Prompt | first_div (Orthrus / Vanilla) | gap | bf16 → int8 token (Orthrus / Vanilla) | bf16 rank in int8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| short | 2 / 2 | 0.75 | ` Below` → ` Here` | 2 |
| long | 35 / 35 | 0.50 | `###` → `##` | 2 |
| math | 3 / 3 | 1.00 | `:\n\n` → ` the` | 2 |
| **explanation** | **8 / 15** | 0.25 / 0.25 | `' CPU' → ' **'` / `',' → ' in'` | **1 / 2** |
| json | 96 / 96 | 0.50 | `Stat` → `Tem` | 2 |
| creative | 0 / 0 | 0.875 | `The` → `**` | 2 |
| apollo | 13 / 13 | 0.50 | ` the` → ` NASA` | 2 |

**6 of 7 prompts: cross-arm divergence events are bit-identical.** Same position, same gap, same bf16 token, same int8 token, same rank. The explanation prompt is the one exception, explained below.

### Finding

**Orthrus is not uniquely fragile to int8 quantization. Both arms exhibit "near-tie regime" perturbation (median gap 0.5, max bf16-rank-in-int8 2) with identical signatures.** The diffusion consensus mechanism does not amplify precision errors; it propagates the AR head's output as-is.

The mechanistic explanation is direct: both arms share the same AR projection weights (Orthrus's diffusion path uses the AR head to verify each block's tokens; the AR-only path uses the same AR head to emit each token). At every position where both arms have the same agreed prefix, the AR head computes the same logits and the int8 cast-and-dequant perturbs them identically. So the same near-tie tips in the same direction in both arms.

### The explanation-prompt exception

The explanation prompt is the only one where the two arms diverge at different positions (Orthrus position 8, Vanilla position 15) with different token pairs. This is the AR-equivalence finding from the previous section showing up here at the second order:

- The AR equivalence section showed that on the explanation prompt, `baseline-bf16` (diffusion mode) and `ar-bf16` (AR mode) agree on tokens for only the first 62 positions before diverging from each other. Within those 62 tokens *where they emit the same tokens*, their internal KV caches differ at the LSB-of-bf16 level (because they were computed via different forward-pass code paths).
- When int8 quantisation is applied on top of those slightly-different KV caches, the perturbation hits a near-tie at *different positions* in the two arms (8 vs 15). The character of the perturbation (gap = 0.25 in both) is the same; only the position differs.
- This is trajectory variance, not architectural fragility. The verdict (gap-based signature similarity) correctly classifies it as "not uniquely fragile."

### Verdict logic

`signatures_similar = True` (Orthrus and Vanilla both report median gap 0.5, max bf16-rank 2 → identical signatures). The script prints `VERDICT: NOT UNIQUELY FRAGILE` and reports each arm's absolute character separately (`near-tie regime (small gaps, rank-1-vs-rank-2 swaps)` for both arms).

The comparison criterion is *similarity between arms*, not absolute thresholds within each. The arms are flagged "uniquely fragile" only when their signatures differ substantively (gap difference > 0.5 OR rank difference > 1). Position differences across arms are ignored — they reflect trajectory variance from cross-code-path fp drift, not architectural fragility. Each arm's absolute character (near-tie / moderate-gap / wide-margin) is reported separately so a reader can distinguish "both arms benign" from "both arms harsh" even when the comparative verdict is the same.

### Side observation: AR-mode through Orthrus runs at 2.6 tok/s on the long prompt

`ar-bf16` generated at 7.4 tok/s on the short prompt and **2.6 tok/s on the long prompt**, vs `baseline-bf16` (Orthrus's normal diffusion mode through the same weights) at 39.1 and 51.5 tok/s respectively. The 19x slowdown on the long prompt is a direct re-measurement of what the diffusion mechanism is buying in tokens-per-wall-clock-second relative to plain AR generation, isolated from any vanilla-Qwen3-baseline confound (same model in the same container at the same precision, just with the diffusion mechanism turned off). Consistent with and independent of the main benchmark's speedup claim.

### Side observation: TPF varies 4.5x across prompts at bf16

Tokens-per-forward-pass (TPF, the per-iteration acceptance length in diffusion mode) varies substantially with prompt complexity, even before quantisation enters the picture:

| Prompt | baseline-bf16 TPF | teacher-int8 TPF | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| math | **12.48** | 9.67 | -2.81 |
| long | 8.73 | 7.82 | -0.92 |
| short | 6.56 | 6.10 | -0.45 |
| json | 6.56 | 6.47 | -0.09 |
| explanation | 4.12 | 3.37 | -0.75 |
| apollo | 3.04 | 2.96 | -0.08 |
| creative | **2.79** | 2.77 | -0.02 |

High-confidence trajectories (math, with predictable arithmetic) give the drafter an easy job and TPF goes up; low-confidence trajectories (creative writing with frequent forks) drop TPF below 3. The headline TPF number of ~6.5 from the main benchmark is a mid-range data point, not a constant property of the model. Int8 quantisation hurts TPF proportionally more on high-confidence prompts (math drops 23%, creative drops 1%) because high-confidence trajectories had the most to lose: more near-deterministic predictions to knock off-path.

### Configurations

Two new entries in the `--configs` set, both using `use_diffusion_mode=False`:

| Config | Mode | Weights |
|---|---|---|
| `ar-bf16` | `use_diffusion_mode=False` | bf16 (no quant) |
| `ar-int8` | `use_diffusion_mode=False` | AR/shared weights → int8 cast-and-dequant (`_diff` projections untouched since they are not accessed in AR mode) |

### Methodology notes

**Why the comparison is within-arm and not cross-arm.** `baseline-bf16` vs `ar-bf16` is the wrong comparison; the AR equivalence section showed those two paths diverge structurally at bf16 from cross-code-path fp drift, with nothing to do with quantization. Each arm's bf16-vs-int8 comparison isolates the int8 effect because the only thing changing within an arm is weight precision.

**Why the metric is first_divergence_position paired with top1-top2 logit gap.** `first_divergence_position` answers "how many tokens of bf16-matching output can I get under int8?" — position-independent of total output length and directly interpretable. Position alone is not enough though: a first divergence at token 5 with a tiny top1-top2 gap means "quantization tipped a near-tie that was already wobbling," not "quantization substantively changed the model's prediction." The fresh-forward divergence diagnostic introduced in the AR equivalence work captures the gap at each divergence, which is what makes the "same kind of perturbation, different trajectories" / "substantively different perturbation" distinction empirically decidable.

### Caveats

- `0.7500` / `0.5000` / `0.2500` logit gaps are suspiciously round; that reflects bf16 quantization of the logit values rather than continuous logit measurements. The gaps are meaningful as ordinal signals (near-tie vs wide-margin) and as comparative signals between arms, not as fine-grained continuous measurements.
- The bit-identical-across-arms pattern on 6/7 prompts is mechanistically expected for any prompt where the two arms agree on the prefix up to first_div; the explanation prompt is the proof of concept that when the two arms' bf16 trajectories *don't* agree at the divergence position (because the cross-code-path cascade fired before first_div), the position breaks apart but the gap signature stays similar. So the cross-arm bit-identity should be read as "this is what happens when no cross-code-path drift has fired yet at the position of interest" rather than as an iron law.
- This investigation uses simulated cast-and-dequant int8 (storage stays bf16, weights round-trip through int8). Real production int8 (bitsandbytes, fp8 native via torchao or torch._scaled_mm, AWQ-int4, etc.) uses different numerical paths and different storage representations; the conclusion ("Orthrus inherits Qwen3 sensitivity, not unique to itself") is expected to hold under those because the mechanistic argument (shared AR weights) is independent of the perturbation kind, but accuracy on downstream eval suites is what would actually validate it.

### How to run

```bash
./run.sh quant_benchmark --no-build
```

Default `--configs` includes all six configurations (four diffusion-mode plus the two AR-mode); default `--prompts` is all 7 entries in `PROMPTS`. Runtime: ~2 hours wall-clock on a DGX Spark. To run only the AR arm: `--configs ar-bf16 --configs ar-int8`; the script auto-includes `ar-bf16` as the within-arm baseline.

## Conclusion: this work enables quantisation in orthrus-serve

The contribution of this benchmark to the question "can we serve Orthrus quantised?" is *eliminative*, not positive. It rules out the methodological doubt that the diffusion consensus mechanism might make Orthrus uniquely fragile to precision loss, which would otherwise have been a blocker for taking quantisation seriously on this architecture.

What this work establishes:

- **Quantisation perturbs Orthrus the same way it perturbs vanilla Qwen3-8B.** Within-arm bf16-vs-int8 comparison shows bit-identical perturbation events across 6 of 7 prompts and signature-similar perturbation on the 7th. Mechanistic: both arms share the same AR projection weights, so the same near-tie tips the same way in both.
- **The diffusion consensus mechanism does not amplify precision errors.** The cross-arm verdict is "NOT UNIQUELY FRAGILE." The diffusion path's verify-and-resample loop propagates the AR head's output as-is rather than compounding precision noise.
- **The `_diff` projections are a quantisation passenger.** Quantising them on top of the AR-side quantisation produces zero additional output divergence. Memory savings on the diffusion-side weights come for free.
- **TPF degrades modestly under int8** (-7 to -10% on most prompts), and the degradation is proportional to prompt confidence: high-confidence trajectories (math: TPF 12.48 → 9.67, -23%) are hit harder than low-confidence ones (creative: TPF 2.79 → 2.77, -1%). The mechanism is that high-confidence trajectories had more near-deterministic predictions to knock off-path.
- **Per-tensor int4 is catastrophic.** TPF collapses to ~1.0 across all prompts; the speedup mechanism is gone entirely and output is gibberish. Int4 needs calibration, per-channel scaling, or higher-bit (NF4, AWQ, GPTQ) tooling to be viable.

What this work does not establish, and which is the natural scope of follow-up work in `orthrus-serve`:

- **Whether the bit-level perturbation patterns hold under real production quant** (fp8 native, bitsandbytes int8, AWQ int4). The simulated cast-and-dequant here is a pessimistic-leaning numerical proxy that stores in bf16 and only round-trips the weights through int representations. The mechanistic argument (shared AR weights → shared perturbation) predicts the conclusion carries over; empirical validation requires a real implementation.
- **Whether downstream task accuracy is preserved.** First_div and gap measure bit-level perturbation, not whether `get_weather(location="Oxford")` still parses or whether a multi-turn agent dialogue stays coherent. Tool-eval-bench and similar suites measure the right thing.
- **Whether throughput actually improves under real quant on Blackwell.** Simulated quant doesn't touch kernels. Native fp8 / int8 quant should improve throughput too (~2× matmul on Blackwell-class hardware), but requires verifying the kernels actually fire on sm_121 rather than falling back to bf16 dequant-then-matmul paths.

**Net handoff to orthrus-serve**: pick a real quant scheme (fp8 first as the cleanest starting point, AWQ-int4 / NF4 as larger-memory-savings follow-ups), wire it into the model load path, validate accuracy on tool-eval-bench, and demonstrate the diffusion speedup carries through at the quantised precision. This bench provides the methodological scaffolding (within-arm comparisons, gap-and-rank diagnostic, the comparative-not-absolute verdict pattern) and the mechanistic intuition (no unique fragility) that justify pursuing that work; the production quant pipeline and accuracy validation itself live in `orthrus-serve`. See `orthrus-serve/quantization.md` for the implementation.

### Update (2026-05-27): what orthrus-serve has since established

The three open questions above are now answered empirically by sweeps run in `orthrus-serve` against tool-eval-bench:

- **Whether bit-level perturbation patterns hold under real production quant**: per-tensor fp8 on Blackwell sm_121 produces the same drafter-friendly perturbation pattern that this bench predicted from simulated int8. fp8 ships as orthrus-serve's recommended default; ~1.33x bf16 throughput, ~1.77x memory reduction, tool-eval-bench score 74/100 (vs bf16's 72/100 — basically a wash).
- **Whether downstream task accuracy is preserved**: tool-eval-bench at fp8 shows all three configs (Orthrus diffusion, Orthrus no-diff, vanilla Qwen3-8B) converge to identical 74/100 with the same 4 safety-critical failures. Direct empirical confirmation of this bench's "Orthrus inherits Qwen3's quantisation sensitivity" finding at the task-accuracy level, not just the bit-perturbation level.
- **Whether throughput actually improves under real quant on Blackwell**: native fp8 matmul fires via `torch._scaled_mm`; HTTP-bench long-prompt throughput goes 51.1 tok/s bf16 → 65.3 tok/s fp8 → 88.9 tok/s NVFP4. Both per-tensor schemes work calibration-free; the int4 question this bench left open as "needs calibration / per-channel scaling / higher-bit tooling" is answered constructively by NVFP4 (4-bit per-block weights with native triton kernels, 2.89x memory reduction, drafter partially preserved with 1.86× speedup, 3-point tool-eval-bench accuracy cost vs fp8).

**One important refinement** from orthrus-serve's work: **drafter survival under quantisation is a function of weight perturbation geometry, not bit width.** Per-row weight scaling (the natural "next step after per-tensor for accuracy") *breaks the diffusion drafter* — each row's coordinated rescale shifts logits non-uniformly, invalidating the drafter's training-time calibration against the unquantised teacher. Per-block (NVFP4) preserves the drafter partially because block-wise scales average out at the row level. Per-tensor preserves the drafter fully. This refines the "Orthrus not uniquely fragile to int8" finding into a sharper rule: the drafter is fragile to *structured per-row* perturbation (even at 8 bits) in a way it is not fragile to *uniform* or *finer-than-row* perturbation (even at 4 bits). The fix for the per-row case would be quantisation-aware drafter retraining (QAT — retraining the drafter against a per-row-quantised teacher), which belongs upstream in Orthrus training code, not in orthrus-serve.

See `orthrus-serve/README.md`'s "Findings: can you quantise an Orthrus model without retraining?" section and `quantization.md`'s "Drafter survival is a spectrum" section for the full empirical breakdown including the no-diff-vs-diff drafter-only speedup measurements (fp8 2.29×, NVFP4 1.86×, fp8-row ~1.0×).

## Limitations and caveats

- Targets sm_121 (GB10) on aarch64. Will not run as-is on x86_64 or other Blackwell variants without container adjustments.
- Uses flash-attn 2 only. FA3/FA4 do not yet support sm_121 as of the time this repo was authored.
- Single GPU only.
- 8B model only, no quantisation.
